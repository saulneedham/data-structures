# Data-Structures

A collection of C# projects completed for the 6G5Z0024 unit, focusing on data structures, algorithmic complexity, and optimization. The repository demonstrates a progression from custom data structure implementation to complex algorithm design.

## 📘 Included Projects
1: Queues - 
Implementation of a manual GuestQueue class and Windows Form Application to manage theme park guests. It features core queue operations (Enqueue/Dequeue), a search function for guest funds, and a k-element reversal logic

2: Trees - 
An expansion of the initial queue structure to support a circular buffer. This task involved refitting all existing logic to account for index wrapping and integrating the system into a real-time interactive GUI

3: Complexity - 
Theoretical Big O analysis of provided functions alongside the development of a Generic Insertion Sort. This utility uses CompareTo() logic to sort any data type within a menu-driven interface

4: Graphs - 
A payload management tool for space exploration that utilizes a Greedy Algorithm. It calculates an optimized 100kg cargo list by evaluating item weight-to-value ratios without the use of fractional items
